{"_id":{"$oid":"574eb025650963030005aa26"},"name":"Ninja - Archery History","group":"archery","category":"Archery - History","description":"The bow was known as a “Yumi” and the arrows were called, “Ya”. The ninja’s bow was short and symmetrical, with a center grip, similar to the larger ones we’ll be training with today. Whereas the longer, asymmetrical Yumi were favored by the Samurai, with the grip lower down on the bow.  The ninja’s shorter bow meant less range on the battlefield, but allowed for closer and more accurate kills with agility.\nNinjas were proficient in using both types of bows, and when needed, could also use the bows from fallen samurai on the battlefield.\nFemale ninja were called “Kunoichi”, and were often experts with the bow and arrow.\nWhen removing the string from the bow, called “slacking”, a ninja could hide the bow with some arrows in a hollow bamboo tube.  This was a great for carrying them over their back, freeing up their hands, or even useful in disguising the assassins as a contractor, who used to carry their blue prints inside bamboo tubes.\nThere were many types of arrows used for different occasions, whether it be a standard arrow head or an explosive one.  Wooden arrows could be dipped in poison to insure any wound was a fatal one.  The Togari-Ya was a simple pointed arrow head design, and a Yanagi-Ba, also known as the “Willow-Leaf” was of a more elegant design.  Rope-cutters were called “Karimata” and had a unique split point. The barbed “Watakushi” was used for tearing flesh. And the Tagone-Ya was shaped like a chisel.\nFor creating a loud whistling effect, the “Kaburi-Ya” was used to strike fear into the hearts of the enemy, or for signalling allies.  These arrows where large enough that they could be signed on, or relay short messages.\nAnd for a more silent approach, certain reeds used with the making of an arrow, could dampen the sound it would make from flying through the air.\nSome say that bamboo arrows were favored among ninjas as they were small and light, making them easy to carry, but still very effective.","__v":0}
